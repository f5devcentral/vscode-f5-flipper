- Enables better querying, validation, and transformation

**Deep Dive Required**:
- [ ] Analyze current RegExTree patterns (`src/regex.ts`)
- [ ] Design new JSON schema for NS config objects
- [ ] Map all NS object types to JSON structure
- [ ] Plan migration path from current to new approach
- [ ] Consider performance implications
- [ ] Design API for querying JSON config

**Implementation Steps**:
- [ ] Create JSON schema definitions for NS objects
- [ ] Extend/refactor regex parser for complete JSON conversion
- [ ] Update ADC class to use new JSON model
- [ ] Refactor digesters to work with JSON model
- [ ] Update tree view provider for JSON model
- [ ] Migration testing with existing configs

**Benefits**:
- More complete representation of NS config
- Easier to query and analyze
- Better foundation for conversions
- Improved diagnostics capabilities
- Potential for config editing/manipulation

- [ ] digCsVserver.ts - Improve from 50% to 80% function coverage
- [ ] digCStoLbRefs.ts - Improve branch coverage to 80%+
- [ ] Create test fixtures for complex NS configs

**Next Steps**:
1. Write tests for nsDiag.ts (diagnostics engine) - 15-20 tests estimated
2. Write tests for fastCore.ts (template processing) - 10-15 tests estimated
3. Expand digCsVserver.ts tests for missing functions
4. Create NetScaler config fixtures with diagnostic issues
